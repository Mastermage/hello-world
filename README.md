Learning how GitHub works
I've been involved in a project using GitHub before, but didn't totally understand how it all worked.  Trying to figure that out now.

Adding another change to test system.

And another to see how modifying in VS Code works.  At least I think I just made a "change".

Now I get it, you have to save the changes before you can commit them.

This is an attempt to see what happens without a commit.  Does it show up in "Changes"

Testing fix of bugs.

Hmmmm....

Trying the "Making and Committing changes"
